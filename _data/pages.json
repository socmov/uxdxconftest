When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security and cannot accept any liability where the security of your Personal Information is compromised.</p>\n<h2>Retention</h2>\n<p>Data will not be held for longer than is necessary for the purpose(s) for which they were obtained. Our policy is that we do not hold credit card details, unless you consent to retain details to ease future transactions.</p>\n<h2>Amendments to this Privacy Policy</h2>\n<p>Should any modifications to this privacy policy be undertaken, a clearly visible notification will be placed on the website so that all users are fully aware of what data we collect, how that data is used, and if and why it is disclosed.</p>\n<p>If we ever decide to use personal information in a considerably different manner to that described in this privacy policy, or otherwise stated to you when you agreed to provide your details, we will inform you by email and you will consequently be able to choose whether or not to permit us to use your information in the amended manner.</p>\n<h1>Refund and Cancellation Policy</h1>\n<p>All purchases of tickets for conferences and events (including hotel rooms if applicable) are non-refundable in their entirety. Your ticket remains the property of UXDX, Socially Motivated Limited and is a personal revocable license, which may be withdrawn, and admission refused at any time upon a refund of the printed registration price.</p>\n<p>In the unlikely event of cancellation of a conference or event the liability of Socially Motivated Limited is limited to the share of paid registration fees that remains after credit card and payment processing fees have been incurred and deducted.<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>It is strictly forbidden for any company, organisation or attendee to attempt to host or organise any event in conjunction with, contiguous to or purporting to be related to UXDX or its affiliates without the express prior permission and cooperation of Socially Motivated Limited. In the event of breach of these terms any tickets purchased by the organiser and their affiliates will be rendered null and void. Socially Motivated Limited reserves their right to take such legal action including a claim for damages as may be appropriate.</p>\n<p><br>\nThe tickets purchased (including hotel rooms if applicable) are for your own personal use or that of your business only and may not be re-sold or transferred for commercial gain under any circumstances, including but not limited to use as part of any promotion or competition. Where there has been any resale or attempted resale of any tickets (or any other breach of this term), we reserve the right to cancel the relevant tickets with immediate effect.<br>\n</p>\n<p>You Can't Resell your Ticket</p>\n<p>We reserve the right to cancel any ticket purchase made by any person or body whom we reasonably believe to be associated with any ticket broker or tout. Socially Motivated Limited reserves the right to refuse admission to any event or conference for any behaviour, which it deems unacceptable, or for breach of the terms and conditions.</p>\n<p>Socially Motivated Limited will not be responsible for any tickets that are lost or stolen. The unauthorised use of photographic and recording equipment at events and conferences is prohibited.</p>\n<p>Socially Motivated Limited will not be liable for any loss injury or damage to any person or property howsoever caused (save for death or personal injury as a result of Socially Motivated Limited's negligence or for any other type of liability that cannot by law be excluded or limited.)</p>\n<p>Socially Motivated Limited will not be liable for the granting of any VISAs that are required to attend any event or conference. In the event that an attendee's VISA is not granted tickets will not be refunded for any event or conference.</p>\n<p>In the event that the purchaser is a consumer and to whom the European Directive on Consumer Rights (Directive 2011 / 83/ EU) applies, the consumer would be entitled to a cooling off period of fourteen days which would begin on the day the contract for distance selling was concluded.</p>\n<p>For questions about registration, assistance with any registration or problems, please contact us at <a href=\"mailto:connect@uxdxconf.com\">connect@uxdxconf.com</a> or use the chat tool on this website.</p>\n<h1>Event Cancellation, Postponement &amp; Substitution Policy</h1>\n<p>Socially Motivated Limited is not responsible for any loss or damage as a result of a substitution, alteration, cancellation or postponement of an event. Socially Motivated Limited shall assume no liability whatsoever in the circumstances that an event is cancelled, rescheduled or postponed due to a fortuitous event, Act of God, unforeseen occurrence or any other event that renders performance of an event impracticable, illegal or impossible. For purposes of this clause, a fortuitous event shall include, but not be limited to: war, fire, labour strike, extreme weather or other emergency.</p>\n<p><br>\nPlease note that while speakers and topics are confirmed at the time of publishing, circumstances beyond the control of the organisers may necessitate substitutions, alterations or cancellations of the speakers and/or topics. As such, Socially Motivated Limited reserves the right to alter or modify the advertised speakers and/or topics if necessary without any liability to you whatsoever. Any substitutions or alterations will be updated on our web page as soon as possible.</p>\n<h1>Delivery Policy</h1>\n<p>Once a successful purchase transaction has been completed, tickets are delivered in electronic soft-copy via email to the email address nominated by the purchaser. For some ticket types it may be necessary to complete required information - such as attendee name - before the tickets can be issued. The ticket acts as a receipt for the transaction and can be used to redeem entry at the event listed on the ticket. A printed hard-copy ticket or an electronic soft-copy ticket detailing the reference number can be used to register at the event.</p>\n<h1>General Clauses</h1>\n<p>Irish law governs these terms and conditions and any dispute are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Irish Courts.</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>No transport of any kind will be provided to or from any event or conference location.</li>\n  <li>You consent to film and sound recording as attendees at any event or conference.</li>\n  <li>Socially Motivated Ltd shall be entitled to delegate the provision of its obligations under this Agreement.</li>\n  <li>No other terms shall apply to this Agreement and these terms contain the entire agreement and understanding between us in respect of all matters which are referred to herein and supersede any prior, written or oral agreement between us relating to such matters.
